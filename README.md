This JavaScript code provides a simple tool to calculate the time difference between the current time and a scheduled event. It prompts the user for the event name, hour, minute, and AM/PM designation, then displays the remaining time until the event.

Features:

User-friendly input prompts for event details.
Accurate time difference calculation, handling cases where the event falls on the next day.
Clear output format displaying the remaining time (hours and minutes) until the event.
How to Use:

Save the code: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., reminder.js) and paste the code into it.

Run the script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute the following command:

Bash
node reminder.js
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Follow the prompts: The script will ask you to enter the event name, hour, minute, and AM/PM designation. Respond to each prompt with the appropriate information.

View the results: Once you've entered all the details, the script will calculate and display the remaining time until your event.

Example:

Event: Doctor's Appointment
sethour: 2
setminutes: 30
am/pm: pm

you have 10:30 till your Doctor's Appointment
Code Improvements:

Removed unnecessary import (http): This import wasn't being used, so it's removed to maintain clarity.
Optimized time calculation: The code now handles potential wrap-around to the next day more efficiently.
Enhanced readability: Minor formatting changes have been made to improve code readability.
Additional Notes:

This script operates in the user's local time zone.
For more complex scheduling needs, consider exploring dedicated calendar or reminder libraries.
